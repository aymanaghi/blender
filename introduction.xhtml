<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Montage is the technique of assembling separate clips (video, audio, text, effects) into a coherent sequence.
The importance of montage was first demonstrated by the Russian filmmaker Lev Kuleshov in the 1910s and 1920s.
Famous is the Kuleshov effect: viewers derive more meaning from the
interaction of two sequential shots than from a single shot in isolation
(see the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuleshov_effect">Wikipedia article</a> for a nice illustration).</p>
<p>Obviously, the first thing in assembling your timeline is importing or adding strips.
There are several ways to do this and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Before you can do anything with a strip, you have to select them. There are multiple ways of selecting strips.</p>
<p>Strips can be moved in time (left to right on the X axis) or in the display stack (bottom to top on the Y axis).</p>
<p>Splitting or cutting a strip will create two parts of the strip (before and after the split).
There are two variants: Split and Hold Split.</p>
<p>Trimming is the process of removing or adding a portion of the video at its head or tail.
This will result in a decrease or increase of the duration of the video.</p>
<p>Grouping is the creating of a meta strip whereby several strips are grouped together.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p>Creating a good montage is a time consuming process.
Therefore, all basic operations (add, split, trim, â€¦) have an associated shortcut.
It pays off to learn these shortcuts, even though the same result could be obtained with the menu and/or mouse.</p>
